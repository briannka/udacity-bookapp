# MyReads Project

This project consists of a simple bookshelf which allows searching for books and adding them to either bookshelf on the main page - 'My Reads', 'To Read' or 'Read'.

## Tech Stack

This project is React based and also incorporates React Router.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Run the project

To run this project locally type `yarn start` in your Terminal
